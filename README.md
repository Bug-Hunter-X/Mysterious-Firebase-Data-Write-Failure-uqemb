# Mysterious Firebase Data Write Failure

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered while using Firebase Realtime Database.  Despite successful user authentication and what appeared to be correctly executed `set()` calls, data was not being written to the database.  The issue was not immediately evident in console logs or through typical debugging methods.  This repository provides the buggy code and the solution.

## Bug Details:

The primary issue was a subtle timing problem related to asynchronous operations. The `set()` method was called before the necessary data (such as the user's unique ID) was fully available. This resulted in an incomplete or invalid write operation that went unnoticed because there weren't any explicit error messages.

## Solution:

The solution involves ensuring that all necessary data is available *before* calling the `set()` method. This was accomplished by using async/await to properly handle the asynchronous operations and ensure all data is resolved before writing to Firebase.
